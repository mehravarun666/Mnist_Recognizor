# Digit Recognition App

This Flutter project implements a digit recognition application using TensorFlow Lite. The app allows users to draw digits (0-9) on a canvas and then predicts the drawn digit with a confidence level using a pre-trained model based on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the app provides voice feedback to the user, narrating the predicted digit.

## Features

- Allows users to draw digits on a canvas.
- Utilizes a TensorFlow Lite model for digit recognition.
- Provides prediction confidence levels.
- Offers voice-over feedback for the drawn digit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/mehravarun666/Mnist_Recognizor.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd digit-recognition-app
3. Install dependencies:
   flutter pub get
4. Run the app:
   flutter run

## Usage

Draw a digit (0-9) on the canvas provided in the app.
Wait for the prediction result to appear with a confidence level.
Listen to the voice-over narration of the predicted digit.
